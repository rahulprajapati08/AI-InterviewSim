# 🎤 AI-InterviewSim — Smart Mock Interview Platform (Prototype)

**AI-InterviewSim** is an AI-powered **mock interview simulation platform** designed to help job seekers practice interviews in a realistic, intelligent, and personalized environment. It uses a combination of **LLMs**, **resume analysis**, and **role-specific question generation** to simulate real-time interviews and provide structured feedback.

---

## 🚀 Current Prototype Features

✅ **Live AI Interview Simulation**  
→ Users can experience dynamic Q&A sessions with an AI interviewer in real-time.

✅ **Resume-Based Questioning**  
→ Upload a resume, and the AI intelligently tailors questions based on user experience and skills.

✅ **Role-Based Interview Mode**  
→ Select a role (e.g., Data Scientist, Backend Developer), and get relevant industry-specific questions.

✅ **Interview Feedback Generation**  
→ At the end of each session, receive a summary feedback evaluating your performance.
